# SMSQ/E

This is a fork of SMSQ/E sources from [Wolfgang Lenerz official SMSQ/E Site](http://www.wlenerz.com/smsqe/). The untouched code is [tagged at 3.37](releases/tag/3.37) which was the most recent version at the time.

This is primarily used for local change tracking and will perhaps evolve into a different direction due to changes that would be interesting for me to have. I will try to do my best to keep it updated with the original version in case of updates.
